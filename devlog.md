### 2024-10-13 - 3hr: More Pre-Playtest Work
* Tried again to implement project mechanic. Struggling to make it so that the Head button functions the same way as the L Arm button.
* Breakthrough made with chatGPT, I attempted to simulate overloaded methods in gdScript because I noticed that my _action method was causing the enemy to move regardless of the button used.
* Progress made due to method overloading solution, but now the problem is that I cannot choose the second enemy, the action goes through as soon as I press a button, making it so that only the first enemy is affected.


### 2024-10-12 - 3hr: Pre-Playtest Work
* Made attacking "turn based" by waiting until every enemy has been selected to initiate the attack
* Updated targeting reticle
* Finished tutorial "https://youtu.be/HEexLmt7enc?si=C21M7QN-WMbyYR4h", have fully implemented the basics of turn based combat, enemies are not currently able to act
* Tried to implement enemy death, but using queue_free() made the code crash because the focus function would try to look for an index that wasn't there anymore. Left in for now
* Tried to implement project mechanic with the assistance of chatGPT, but could not get the Head button to function as intended
